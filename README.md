# Reactive API Rest

### Reference Documentation
In this project we developed a reactive API using as a store layer a mongoDB and the suite of reactive dependencies 
for mongo and web, handling in this way endpoints that return ResponseEntities with Flux or Mono.
Besides that we also learned how to handle user requests but instead of using controllers we used the RouterFunction that
just act of middleman.
Apart from that we also implemented junit test for the code in two ways one running a real server and mocking it.
Finally, we also validate every attribute of the entities.
